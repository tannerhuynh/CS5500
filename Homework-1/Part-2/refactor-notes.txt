Person Class:
Refactored equals to remove redundant true/false statements.
Now it shall only return true or false in less computations.

MatchMaker Class:
Refactored makeMatches by moving out the checkSize function to check and output a message if there are odd numbers of people.

Refactored setupGroups by adding a helper function for sorting the person.

Refactored makeMatches to be one main function with several helper functions.

Refactor for functions into foreach function makes the code more readable.
Helper functions help developers debug easily.

Added documentation for classes and comments where necessary to help with readability and understand the classes.
